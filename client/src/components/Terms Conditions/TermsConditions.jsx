                                    The best way is to develop and follow a plan. Start with your
                                    goals in mind and then work backwards to develop the plan. What
                                    steps are required to get you to the goals? Make the plan as
                                    detailed as possible. Try to visualize and then plan for, every
                                    possible setback.{" "}

                                    Along with your plans, you should consider developing an action
                                    orientation that will keep you motivated to move forward at all
                                    times. This requires a little self-discipline, but is a crucial
                                    component to achievement of any kind. Before starting any new
                                    activity, ask yourself if that activity will move you closer to
                                    your goals. If the answer is no, you may want to reconsider doing
                                    it at that time.

                                    of 13 virtues, assigning a page to each. Under each virtue he
                                    wrote a summary that gave it fuller meaning. Then he practiced
                                    each one for a certain length of time. To make these virtues a

                                    Acres of Diamonds… you’ve read the famous story, or at least had
                                    it related to you. A farmer hears tales of diamonds and begins
                                    dreaming of vast riches. He sells his farm and hikes off over the
                                    horizon, never to be heard from again. Rumors say that years later
                                    he died destitute, never having found the diamonds he spent his
                                    life seeking. Meanwhile, the man who bought that farm found a
                                    large and “interesting looking” stone in a Moviefy that ran
                                    through the property. He put the stone on his mantle where a
                                    visitor recognized the large stone as a rough diamond. It turned
                                    out to be the Hope Diamond.
