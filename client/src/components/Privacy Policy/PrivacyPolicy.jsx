                                    Without clarity, you send a very garbled message out to the
                                    Universe. We know that the Law of Attraction says that we will
                                    attract what we focus on, so if we don’t have clarity, we will
                                    attract confusion.

                                    The best way is to develop and follow a plan. Start with your
                                    goals in mind and then work backwards to develop the plan. What
                                    steps are required to get you to the goals? Make the plan as
                                    detailed as possible. Try to visualize and then plan for,{" "}

                                    every possible setback. Commit the plan to paper and then keep it
                                    with you at all times. Review it regularly and ensure that every
                                    step takes you closer to your Vision and Goals. If the plan
                                    doesn’t support the vision then change it!

                                    as Michael Jordan and Bill Gates. We can look a bit further back
                                    in time to Albert Einstein or even further back to Abraham
                                    Lincoln. What made each of these people so successful? Motivation.

                                    The first thing to remember about success is that it is a process
                                    – nothing more, nothing less. There is really no magic to it and
                                    it’s not reserved only for a select few people. As such, success
                                    really has nothing to do with luck, coincidence or fate. It really
                                    comes down to understanding the steps in the process and then
                                    executing on those steps.

                                    There are basically six key areas to higher achievement. Some
                                    people will tell you there are four while others may tell you
                                    there are eight. One thing for certain though, is that
                                    irrespective of the number of steps the experts talk about, they
                                    all originate from the same roots.
